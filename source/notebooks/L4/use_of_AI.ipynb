On the other hand, LLM, or Large Language Model, is a specific category of AI models designed to process and generate human language text. ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is one common example of an LLM, created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), which excels in understanding and generating human-like text, making it useful for tasks like chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation."

    "ChatGPT ,as an example of a LLM, can be a useful tool for creating parts of code when used with clear and specific prompts. Good prompts may yield useful code, while vague or unclear prompts usually result in unhelpful or wrong responses. Remember to be aware of ChatGPT's limitations and thoroughly review the generated code to ensure it meets your requirements and standards.\n",
    "ChatGPT has its limitations, and it's important to be aware of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of Context: ChatGPT generates code based on the provided prompt, but it may not understand the broader context of your project or requirements.\n",
    "* Complex Logic: While ChatGPT can handle simple functions well, it may struggle with complex logic, intricate algorithms, or code that requires domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "* Testing: Always thoroughly test the code generated by ChatGPT to ensure it functions as expected and doesn't have vulnerabilities.\n",
    "* Security: Be cautious when using ChatGPT to generate code for security-critical applications, as it may not consider all security risks.\n",

    "AI models can help you with certain tasks but be cautious with how you use them. The results can vary significantly depending on your prompt. Where there is nor information or context provided, the model makes assumptions which may not be accurate. And remember not to fully trust the result, AIs are smart but they DO make mistakes sometimes.  "
